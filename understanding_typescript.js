1 GETTING STARTED
- ts is a js superset - builds on js but adds new features and advantages
- ts cannot be executed by the browser or node
- environments where we can execute js do not support ts
- ts is a programming language but also a tool - powerful compiler that runs over your code to compile ts code to js
- ts --> js
- ts adds new features via the compiler
- adds types to the js lanaguage that gives you the opportunity to type things.
- extra error checking
- any time you access the value of an input element in js, it is always a string.
- can convert a variable to a number by add + in front of the variable
- ! means the variable will never be null
- :type (example -- :number) typecasts to this type
